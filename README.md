# Chess Move Suggestion Tool

This Python script is a simple tool that reads a PGN (Portable Game Notation) file containing a chess game and suggests the next best move for the current position in the game using the Stockfish chess engine. It provides a command-line interface for analyzing and recommending the next move in a given chess position.

All it did when I first started was read the PNG but it's been since expanded to suggest the next best move also

## Requirements

Before using this tool, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/download/) chess engine: Ensure that Stockfish is installed and accessible in your system. You need to specify the path to the Stockfish binary in the script.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`suggest_move.py`).

3. Run the script with the PGN file as a command-line argument:

   ```sh
   python suggest_move.py your_game.pgn
